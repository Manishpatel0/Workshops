## GRAPH

# Overview

*/
Graph is a datastructure to model the 
mathematical Graphs. lt consists of a set of 
connected pairs called edges of vertices. We
can represent a graph using an array of vertices and a two dimentioal array of edges.

# Basic Operatons
+ Add Vertex - add a vertex to a graph
+ Add Edge - add an edge b/w two vertices of a graph
+ Display Vertex - display a vertex of a graph

# Traversal Algorithms
+ Depth First Search - traverses a graph in depthwards motion.
+ Breadth First Search - traverses a grap in breadthwards motion.
